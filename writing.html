            <h2>The bow of Heavens and Earth</h2>
            <p>I still haven't figured out the proper justification of the butterflies that circle my mind when I think of you.<br>
                A million words in hundreds of languages, but not a single word that would perfectly describe you.<br>
                With each passing second, the only thing my soul does is falling for each version of you, <br>
                falling so intense that even the deep blue ocean and the never ending sky would bow at it.<br>
                The sparkle that twinkles in my eyes when I get a glimpse of you, the sparkle so luminous that<br>
                 even the blazing Sun and the dazzling stars would bow at it.<br>
                I might just be a lunatic crackhead in your perception, but if only you could fit into my shoes and see yourself,<br>
                 then you wouldn't wonder why poetry flows in me.<br>
                Just like the king of the Night, the masterpiece of nature, the Moon, you are out of my reach<br>
                 but I could still adore and reminisce of my unrequited memories just as I sense the beauty of your heart molded<br>
                  in the form of a natural satellite being miles away. <br>
            
                This distance is never going to perish so probably I am going to heal my soul <br>
                by saying "but if the stars had not been at distance there would never form such amazing constellation".

            <p>
                There's a boy who is the sweetest, <br>
                A boy who has the loveliest smile, <br>
                A boy who makes my world a heaven on earth,<br>
                A boy whose existence is a gift to this world,<br>
                A boy who inspires and motivates me always, <br>
                A boy without whom I can't even imagine my significance, <br>
                A boy who rules over my heart, <br>
                A boy who has bewitched my soul, <br>
                A boy who made me understand how beautiful love can be,<br>
                A boy who makes me feel like I'm at the top of the world,<br> 
                A boy for whom I could even give my soul without questioning,<br>
                A boy for whom I could go to any heights to make him happy, <br>
                A boy for whom I would wait a lifetime for. He is the boy I have submitted my heart to; he is my Faizan. <br>

            <h2>Description of perfection</h2>
            <p>
                So he has these dark eyeballs, hidden in his thin eyesockets which remind me of the luminous pearls hidden in seashells,<br>
                 and they glint with an unexplainable spark, the spark similar to the golden rays of the  compressed setting sun at the <br>
                 interface of ocean and sky. The veins of his hands are just as those strong fresh streams of rivers flowing in thick rain<br>
                  forests and his face outlines they force me to accept that God has taken a little extra time to sketch it with such delicacy<br>
                   and artistry, and  when he walks its like he's taking a whole bubble of masculinity around him not the dominating<br>
                    kind but the soft kind and when he smiles with those dark eyeballs barely visible he reflects a magical light,<br>
                     the light which sparkles everything and everyone around him. As if all this wasn't enough he often puts on that<br>
                      black shrug which isolates him from the group of ordinary humans, and makes him an epitome of God's <br>
                      most wonderful earthly creation.

            <p>
                I could write a universe of things about you, but I will never find the words which would perfectly describe you.<br>
You are like the summer rain which brings cold bliss.<br>
You are like the exquisite aurora in the dark sky of mine.<br>
While I might just be a gloomy star in your galaxy but for me, the only universe known is the one named of you.<br>

            <p>The moment my eyes caught a glimpse of you, they felt elated of their existence.<br>
                The zephyr(cold breeze) inside me awakened and began blowing its magic.<br>
                My feet trembled as if they have experience the deadliest earthquake which they knew were gulping them up yet they yearned to get buried in it.<br>
                My hands went cold as if they were losing their life unable to handle your most alluring significance.<br>

            <h2>Dear Bench,</h2>
            <p>
                Dear Mr. Bench, I used to think about going back to the day I replied to you and erasing your existence and significance from my life.<br> I used to think that if I hadn't attended the class that day<br>
                I would be happier<br>
                I would be at peace<br>
                I would grow<br>
                But I was wrong. I was wrong in thinking that my life would be much more beautiful and fruitful without you.<br> The truth is, it is my desire to be worthy of you that drives me to be the best version of myself, which would never have happened had you not been that desire of mine.<br> I desperately and consistently work for it every day.<br>
                You gave a definition to my life. <br>
                You became a source of guidance. <br>
                You became the source of my inspiration. You helped me increase my faith in Allah. You helped me grow in my deen and Dunya. <br>
                Without you realizing or even knowing, you even became the sole source of my joy and peace. <br>

                To my love,<br>
                To my dear Faizan,<br>
                You came into my life at a point where I had planned to wash my hands away from desiring to<br>
                 get the love reciprocated, you entered as a cold breeze and healed the wounds of my heart with your love,<br>
                  you make me feel worthy, important and special.
                Being in love with you feels like privilege,<br>
                 I fall in love with you every moment and I'll keep falling till my last breath, <br>
                 you have won my heart and this can never belong to anyone ever again till life sustains<br>
                  and even after it, my significance exists with you, your love has nurtured me, <br>
                  your love has transformed my life, your love has made me fall in love with me and the world around me,<br>
                   your love has blossomed the most prettiest flowers of my heart, your love has made me alive, <br>
                   it's because of you I cherish every moment I breathe, thank you for gifting me with the privilege<br>
                    of being happy and living my life to the fullest, <br>
                I LOVE YOU FAIZAN, I love you so much, my love for you is vaster than the infinite universe, deeper than the deepest oceans,<br> 
                Yes I am aware of the fact ki my love is insanely high, unusual probably even clingy<br>
                 but you my love, have won my heart for this life and hereafter, it's in your love that it <br>
                 feels alive and it will continue loving you always and forever.

تمہارے لئے لکھنا دل کی آرزو ہے،<br>
